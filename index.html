                <h3>Coffee is a beverage prepared from roasted coffee beans.</h3>
                <p>Coffee is an intricate mixture of more than a thousand chemicals. The cup of coffee you order from a coffee shop is likely different from the coffee you brew at home. What defines a cup is the type of coffee bean used, how it is roasted, the amount of grind, and how it is brewed. Human response to coffee or caffeine can also vary substantially across individuals. Low to moderate doses of caffeine (50–300 mg) may cause increased alertness, energy, and ability to concentrate, while higher doses may have negative effects such as anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, and increased heart rate.</p>

                <h3>Time With coffee</h3>
                <p>When is the best time for coffee? The best time to drink coffee if you have a normal sleep schedule is between 10 AM and 12 PM. Instead of pounding a couple cups after you stumble out of bed, to maximize caffeine’s effects you need to wait a couple hours after you wake-up.</p>

When I look into your eyes, I keep on looking at them. I can't ever stop looking at them. Your eyes speak volumes to me in unsaid words...</p>
